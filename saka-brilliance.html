								<p> Whenever we talk about Arsenal, Bukayo Saka is starting to turn into one of those players where you feel like he didn't do much but then you check his numbers and watch the games back a couple of times (if that's your thing, hey why not?) and you say "ahh, Saka is good".
                                    So let's take a look at how his current season performance compares to last (this is taken before the PSG game in October): </p>

                                <p>Can we draw any conclusion from the charts above? I would caution against drawing a sweeping conclusion, for one the sample size is super small (nearly 3000 minutes last season vs. 548 minutes this season). The context also matters, against Manchester City, Saka only played the first half and was replaced by Ben White as Mikel Arteta shut up shop in an attempt to hang on to a slender lead. Arsenal also had a tough slate of opening fixtures particularly from home (Aston Villa, Tottenham Hotspur, and Manchester City in the league along with Atalanta in the Champions League), where keeping a compact shape and working hard to press off the ball are the orders of the day.</p>
                                <p>The right-hand side of Arsenal's attack for the past few seasons has been consistent with Ben White, Martin Ødegaard, and Saka combining to devastating effects. This season, White has been in and out of the starting eleven with Mikel Arteta introducing Jurrien Timber in his place (he's also had a bit of an injury issue), Ødegaard also suffered an injury while playing for Norway and has been absent since last month. It's understandable if Saka needs to adapt his game to those around him while White and Ødegaard is not in the starting line-up.</p>
                                <p>Saka also played a lot of football going into the current season, he was a regular starter for Arsenal last season (he made 35 appearances in the league, all starts), and he also played a major role for England in the European Championship where they made the final. With all these factors, a slow(er) start might be expected for Saka this season.</p>
                                <p>That said, Saka has been incredibly consistent to the point where you might not notice him as much, last season in the league he averaged 0.33 non-penalty expected goals (npxG) along with three (3.14 to be exact) shots per 90. This season? It's 0.32 and 3.40 respectively, putting him in the 99th percentile for both categories.</p>
                                <p>The scary thing for opposition is that Saka is turning into someone where you have to throw your hands up and pick your poison. If you take away his shooting and goal-scoring (although the number indicates it's just a matter of time before that picks up), he will hurt you with his passing. I mean look at this:</p>
                                <ul>
									<p><b>Assists per 90:</b> 0.28 (last season) v 0.95 (this season)</p>
                                	<p><b>npxG + xA per 90:</b> 0.65 v 0.79</p>
                                	<p><b>Shot Creating Actions per 90:</b> 5.8 v 7.18</p>
								</ul>
                                <p>One thing that Saka has been really good at this season is from set pieces. Against Manchester City and Leicester, he constantly delivered excellent deliveries (Gabriel must be salivating every time Arsenal wins a corner). Against PSG yesterday, his delivery and Arsenal's set-piece threat led to Arsenal's second goal of the game, as PSG failed to deal with Saka's delivery and Donnaruma was somewhat unsighted with the sea of legs trying to attack the ball (<a href="https://youtu.be/UwuM6vrQA-Q?si=juNpSBVzYdFpiiJF&t=228">Here's the goal</a>).</p>
                                <p>After last night's game, Saka said:</p>
                                <blockquote>"I don’t want to put too much pressure on us but I do think that this is the year [that we can win the title]."</blockquote>
                                <p>If Saka continues to perform like he did thus far, the two-decade wait might finally come to an end.</p>
