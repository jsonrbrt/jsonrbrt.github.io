									<h1>Europe's Most Lethal Attackers</h1>
									<p>Is Manchester United about to have the deadliest duo?.</p>
								</header>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images/MbeumoCunha-split.jpeg" alt="" /></div>
								<p>Comparing attackers across different leagues is a challenge - the ability to score goals for fun in France may not necessarily translate to banging goals in Germany's Bundesliga. Different teams have different style of playing, and each league have their own unique characteristics. Often, a player did not set fire in one league, moved to a different league before returning and excelling, much to the chagrin of the first club (Mo Salah, Kevin de Bruyne anyone?)</p>
								<p>Keeping that in mind, this is an imperfect exercise in comparing attackers across Europe's Big 5 leagues. We want to see which forwards overperformed their non-penalty expected goals (npxG) compared to the goals they scored.</p>
								<div class="col-4"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/top_overperformers.png" alt="" /></span></div>
								<p>Two Premier League forwards, Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha leads the way - combining for 30 non-penalty goals and outperformed their npxG by 14 goals. Manchester United already completed the signing of Matheus Cunha and is pursuing Bryan Mbeumo from Brentford. With their track record in signings, United is about to pair the league's deadliest duo or sign two players from clubs that finished 10th and 16th in the league - who just happened to have a very good season (this is the first time both Mbeumo and Cunha overperformed their npxG in the Premier League).</p>
								<p>Mason Greenwood's appearance in the list perhaps brought a sense of 'what might've been' for United fans (and yes, United were right to move on from him). The pair of Mateo Retegui and Ademola Lookman (a former Premier League player) banging in the goals for Atalanta while Rasmus Hojlund struggled probably won't make United fans any happier.</p>
								<p>Other names familiar to Premier League fans includes two Spanish pair in Ayoze Perez (formerly of Newcastle United and Leicester City) and Sandro Ramirez, who was in the books of Everton for three seasons but only had half-a-season spell at Goodison Park making eight appearances. Again this underline the difficulty of comparing players' performance across league and how it might translate if the player made the switch. Arsenal fans are about to undergo a summer full of reading think piece comparing Benjamin Sesko and Viktor Gyokeres. The former represent youth and potential although not quite banging it in a la Haaland while he was at Borussia Dortmund (honestly who does?), while the latter had to go down to the Championship before moving to Sporting in Portugal to fulfill his potential, then again Islam Slimani, Carlos Vinicius and Darwin Nunez also scored for fun in Primeira Liga but didn't set the Premier League alight.</p>
