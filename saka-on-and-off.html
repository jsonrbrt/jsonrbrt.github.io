									<h1>Saka's Impact on Arsenal Attack</h1>
									<p>Analyzing how Arsenal fared without their talisman.</p>

                                <p>Injury to key players was a common theme for Arsenal last season. Club captain Martin Ødegaard missed some time after picking up an injury while on international duty with Norway. Ben White, who was ever present since joining Arsenal back in 2021 played in 107 games the previous three seasons (starting all but four of them), only played in 17 league games. Takehiro Tomiyasu lasted five minutes in what turned out to be his last appearance for the club.</p>
								<p>As you can see in the table below among the top eight players that played the most minutes in the league in 2023/2024, five of them (Ødegaard, Gabriel Magalhães, Bukayo Saka, Kai Havertz, and White ) suffered massive drop offs last season, all of them sustaining significant injuries.</p>

								<p>But it was in attack where Arsenal was decimated, in the space of less than two months, Saka, Gabriel Jesus, and Havertz sustained significant injuries. Out of the trio, Jesus hasn't made an appearance since as he's still recovering from a knee injury.</p>
								<p>Mikel Arteta, who said in 2022 that top players play "70 matches a season, every three days, make the difference and win the game," when asked about the possibility of Bukayo Saka playing too many games, tends to stick with a core group of players, Saka included. So when Saka missed nearly three months of the season, how did it impact Arsenal?</p>

                                <p>The chart above shows Arsenal remain potent without Saka. When he's off the pitch, Arsenal's expected goals (xG) and Shots On Target drops slightly, but when we consider the amount of minutes Arsenal played without Saka last season, a drop of 4.8 xG would've turn one of those draws (of which Arsenal has 14 in the league last season) possibly into a win.</p>
